## Front End for Northcoders News Website

By [Patrick Mackintosh](https://github.com/PatrickGMack)

`Motivation`

This is the frontend to an end to end Northcoders News website, developed over 2 weeks during an intensive coding bootcamp.

On the website users can view the many articles available, comment on the articles as well as vote up or down other comments and news. Users are able to filter news by topic, date, most popular and most engaged with.

`Using the Repo`

To run the project locally, clone the project to your computer and run the following command to install the project's dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Once in the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the application in development mode and will open up http://localhost:3000 to view in the broswer.

To run the tests, run:

```
npm test
```
